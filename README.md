_Draft: **Statistical Methods**_

_This draft is a guide in progress into Statistical Methods_



There is a difference between doing data science and knowing data science. This is an attempt to bridge that gap. Within these pages is a collection of resources to both understand and put into context mathematical concepts used in data science.

**How to use this guide**

This guide assumes basic knowledge in R programming which is commonly used in statistical computing or courses on the same. Should you lack this, I recommend the guide [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/).

It is recommended that you follow this guide as is written unless:

1. You are familiar with the preceding topics and want to target one in particular
2. Specified within the documentation(as is so in [Simple Linear Regression](coursework/regression-analysis/simple-linear-regression.md))
